# Material-classification
This is my master thesis project 

Material classification algorithm using MMWave radar


### Requirements:

- Infineon bgt60tr13c shield + MCU7
- Python 3.7
- Infineon Radar SDK

### Introduction

The work is inspired by RadarCat.

The idea is to explore DCNN for material classification using spectrograms.
